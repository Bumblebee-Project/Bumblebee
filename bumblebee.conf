# WARNING ! Power management is a very unstable feature for now, use it at your
# own risk. You won't get any support if you use this function. Please set
# first /etc/bumblebee/cardon and /etc/bumblebee/cardoff by just writing your
# calls there (one per line) and nothing else or you will face errors :
# \_SB.PCI0.PEG0.GFX0_ON
# Or :
# \_SB.PCI0.RP00.VGA._DSM {0x01,0x02} 0x03 0x04 {0x1,0x0,0x0,0x3}
# \_SB.PCI0.RP00.VGA._PS0
# You should also set STOP_SERVICE_ON_EXIT to Y if you really want to save
# power/battery life.
# See https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/ACPI-for-Developers

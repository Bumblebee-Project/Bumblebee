Version 3.2 - 22 April 2013

Highlights:
 - [new] Implemented -b none option for optirun to disable injection of any
   render offloading bridge (primus or VirtualGL). Use this to invoke
   nvidia-settings (optirun -b none nvidia-settings -c :8).
 - [new] Implemented --no-xorg option for optirun to disable starting secondary
   X server. Use this to run CUDA or OpenCL applications that do not need the
   graphics rendering capabilities. Implies -b none.
 - [enhancement] Added support for passing -configdir to X, defaulting to
   /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.d, --xconfdir option added to bumblebeed and
   XorgConfDir added to bumblebee.conf; this finally fixes a long-standing
   annoyance with SNA config option for the Intel driver.
 - [enhancement] Minor changes in xorg.conf files: unified Device[01] to
   DiscreteNvidia, moved BusID to xorg.conf.d/busid.conf.
 - [enhancement] Added --primus-ldpath and PrimusLibraryPath options to set
 - [enhancement] PRIMUS_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.We do not depend on primusrun script
   anymore for primus backend, note that primusrun and optirun -b primus will
   have different behavior, the first one will power on the discrete GPU when
   needed, while the second one will do it immediately; the difference in
   behavior is most noticeable with WebGL content in Firefox.
 - [fix] Added /usr/$LIB/mesa/libGL.so.1 to default primus libGLd for supporting
   Ubuntu 13.04.
 - [fix] Fixed --pidfile documentation.
 - [fix] Fixed a "buffer overflow" issue in bumblebeed.
 - [fix] Removed accesses to PCI config space from the daemon process.

Important note for packagers:
In this release, we have extended our nvidia-specific udev rule file to add
device files (/dev/nvidia*) when the module is loaded (previously it would only
remove those files when the module is unloaded). Consequently, we also changed
its name. Some distributions, for example Gentoo, do not need to install this
rule file because they already have a similar mechanism in place. Please also
note that the rule file sets file permissions to 0666; you may want to adjust it
to set permissions/owner/group more strictly according to your distribution's
practice before installing. If you already use the kernel module options to
declare permissions, simply running nvidia-smi on module load will do the job.

Notes:
- bbswitch is independent of the driver; vga_switcheroo works for nouveau only.
  See also the Known Issues section above and
  https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Comparison-of-PM-methods
- the video drivers must be unloadable. This means that it should not be
  compiled into the kernel. When using dynamically built modules like nvidia,
  be sure that the toolchain used for building the kernel matches the one that
  is used for building the module. This means that Ubuntu mainline kernels do
  not work and will cause crashes.
- VirtualGL performance is very dependent on the Transport method set. The
  default "proxy" setting appears to perform bad in some situations. Try other
  available settings like "rgb" or "yuv".
- primus is supposed to result in better performance, but is not compatible with
  all programs supported by virtualgl (however it's going far better each day),
  hence virtualgl is preferred when auto-detecting the backend.

Known issues:
- vga-switcheroo won't survive suspension/hibernation (patch for newer Optimus 
  machines for OFF to work has been published in Kernel 3.3; a good patch for 
  suspend is still being prepared).
- bbswitch cannot disable the discrete nvidia card for the Dell Vostro 360
  desktop with Synergy. If you have a machine using that technology, please
  submit your machine information on: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/752542
- Some laptops (mainly Lenovo) are neither supported by bbswitch nor the video 
  drivers. See https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bbswitch/issues/2. This is
  fixed in Linux Kernel 3.9.
